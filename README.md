# NineMansMorrisGame
A simple nine mans morris game made with the SFML library

If your SFML library isn't recognized, make sure to add additional dependencies and additional libraries to your project properties.
Also under c/c++ -> input you want to add "sfml-main-d.lib;sfml-graphics-d.lib;sfml-window-d.lib;sfml-system-d.lib;sfml-audio-d.lib;sfml-network-d.lib"

Have fun
